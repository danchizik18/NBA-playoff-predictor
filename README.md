Used pandas to obtain and clean data for every NBA season from 2016-2024 and trained a random forest model on those seasons to predict each team's wins in the playoffs. Once we obtained an average RMSE of just 1.1 wins, we used the model to predict the 2025 playoffs. We also plan to continue improving the model by adding in nicher data and using fan sentiment, which we web scraped off the internet and perfomred sentiment analysis on using NLTK.
